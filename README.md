An open-source project to help California tenants resist eviction. Eviction from homes is the single greatest cause of permanent homelessness; around 5 evictions happen EVERY DAY in Alameda County alone, and the homeless population there has exploded by 43% in the past year.
 
 This web app was bootstrapped using Create-React-App, and won the 2019 LexLab/UC Hastings Homelessness Hack hackathon in San Francisco. Our team's initial beta is live here: https://caresistevictions.herokuapp.com/
 
 The goal is to build an easily accessible resource for people to learn about the eviction process and how to fight it in court. We're looking for contributors to help build out various features and improve the UX/UI to serve real people in need.

We have an open issues page; feel free to add issues or suggest features there. To contribute, please fork the repo, make changes to a feature branch(labeled descriptively like "add_attorneylist_page"), and open a pull request. Read more about this workflow here: https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/

*Note: we are trying to keep this app as performant as possible for people on limited data plans, old phones or otherwise limited Internet access. Bootstrap/jQuery may be necessary eventually, but small custom CSS is the current project paradigm, since third-party scripts add a lot of weight. Please open an issue if you are designing components that need advanced styling, React styled-components may be a good project option, and discussion of other options is welcome.
